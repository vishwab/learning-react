Brooksource Project Req
=======================
The following task will give me a better understanding of where you are with React, and what can be done to improve your abilities.
Suppose I wanted to create a web app that allowed me to produce a grocery shopping list. I should be able to add items with a freeform input to a list, and once I’ve acquired that item I should be able to move that item from the “need to buy” list to the “in my cart” list…this way I know what I’ve already got.
Create a React App which has a text input to accept names of products, once submitted the product name should appear in the “need to buy” list. Allow me to move items from “need to buy” to “in my cart” with whatever action you feel is best.
The App should consist of at least
1.	Input Field
2.	Two Lists “in my cart” and “need to buy”
3.	Validation to ensure you don’t use the input field to add a product that is already in “need to buy” or “in my cart”
4.	A way to move an item from “need to buy” to “in my cart” 
5.	A way to move an item from “in my cart” back to “need to buy”
Programmatically this should take less than one hour. Feel free to style it as you see fit. 
Upload your code to a public GitHub repository and send me the link as soon as possible. We will discuss the source and ways (if any) to improve it. Do not get help from anyone else during this assignment. You will be expected to complete your own work at Florida Blue; the same should be said for this assignment.
